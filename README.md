  ## Description 
  This project was built as a back-end development for a newly made social media company. One can create users, retrieve all or one of them, update a user and delete users. Further one can add friends and remove them. Users have the capability to create posts and leave comments via thoughts and reactions. We can delete thoughts and reactions as well. This project using a mongoDB that allows for seamless storage of unrelated data and makes it easy to retrieve as well. Hardest parts were understanding how and why the adding of friends and deleting them even made sense to begin with. Still learning those aspects of building the routes. All in all finished this assignment relatively quickly with the assistance of a couple classmates.
